# When the mix of modern C++ features surprise you

Copy elision, move semantics, auto keyword.

Presentation on C++ feature interactions that might not have worked well at the time...
Analysis + case study.
And how it was fixed on a standard wording level.
Plus some direction on where C++ will head in the future.

## How to open

The easiest way would be to simply open [pdf](https://github.com/bondyr/rvo_ppt/blob/master/rvo_ppt.pdf)
But you may also download the whole repo and open index_rvo.html in your browser.
